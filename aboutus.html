        <h2>Company History</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Our company, ABC Enterprises, was founded in 2005 by John Smith. The idea for the business came about when John noticed a gap in the market for high-quality, eco-friendly cleaning products. With his background in chemistry and his passion for environmental sustainability, he set out to create a company that would provide effective cleaning solutions while minimizing harm to the planet.

            In the early years, ABC Enterprises operated as a small-scale operation, manufacturing and selling its products locally. John personally developed the formulas for our flagship products, and with a commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, the business began to gain traction in the market.
            
            As the demand for eco-friendly products grew, ABC Enterprises expanded its operations and distribution network. In 2010, we opened our first manufacturing facility, allowing us to scale up production and meet the increasing customer demand. This expansion enabled us to reach customers across the country through partnerships with local retailers and online platforms.
            
            In 2015, ABC Enterprises achieved a significant milestone when we obtained our first major national retail account. This partnership not only boosted our sales but also provided us with valuable exposure and credibility in the industry. It served as a turning point for our company, propelling us into a phase of rapid growth and expansion.
            
            Over the years, we have continued to innovate and develop new products that align with our commitment to sustainability and customer satisfaction. We have invested in research and development to create cutting-edge formulas that are both effective and environmentally friendly.
            
            Today, ABC Enterprises is a recognized leader in the eco-friendly cleaning product industry. We have a diverse customer base ranging from individual consumers to commercial clients. Our products can be found in major retail stores across the country, and we also have a strong online presence through our e-commerce platform.
            
            Looking ahead, we are committed to further growth and market expansion. We plan to explore international markets and continue developing innovative cleaning solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our focus remains on delivering superior products while maintaining our core values of sustainability, quality, and customer satisfaction.
